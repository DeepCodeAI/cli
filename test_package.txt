TODO:
	- write auto-testing scripts
		- how to pass script to virtual environment? (or drop venv and clean up using other commands instead?)
		- how to handle interactive I/O requirement? (just for login: could use predefined config for other tests) 



To test the released cli package in a clean environment, run:

	# Remove config (required to re-trigger login/setup info querying)
	rm ~/.deepcodeconfig
	# Switch to clean virtual environment
	virtualenv python3 -p python3
	source python3/bin/activate
	# Install and use cli
	pip install deepcode
	deepcode login

After interactively performing the login and remote transfer confirmation,
positive cli output and a proper ~/.deepcodeconfig should be generated
(version 0.0.4 fails with a JSON error instead).
